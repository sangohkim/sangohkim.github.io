Hello, I'm Sangoh Kim. I'm an undergraduate student majoring computer science at KAIST.
Currently, I'm studying about **multimodal learning**, **efficient learning**, **graph neural networks**.
Also, I'm conducting research about **compositional generalization** in scene graph generation.
Ultimately, I want to integrate AI models to downstream services via efficient learning/inference!
