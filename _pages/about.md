I'm interested in mobile application development and Artificial Intelligence.
Currently, I'm developing the KAIST's official community application [Ara](https://github.com/sparcs-kaist/new-ara-app) with
cross-platform framework Flutter. Also, I'm trying to apply data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning techniques for
solving various problems in real world!
